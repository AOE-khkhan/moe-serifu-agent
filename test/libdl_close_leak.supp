# The implementation of libdl used by Valgrind introduces a memory leak in
# programs that are compiled with -lpthread when dlclose() is called from a
# different thread than the one that called dlopen().
#
# This has been observed in v3.10 of Valgrind on Debian and v3.11 of Valgrind
# on Ubuntu.
#
# This suppression file keeps that leak from the output of our test program.
