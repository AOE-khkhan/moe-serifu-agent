# Built-in Commands

## Getting Help

At any point a user can enter `help` into the prompt to get a list of available commands. To view help text for a 
specific command type `help [command name]` where `[command name]` is the name of the command you wish to know more 
about.

## Echo

The echo command causes the MSA to repeat back to you what you enter. For example, entering `echo hello world` will
cause the MSA to say `hello world`.

## Quit

Shuts down the MSA and exits.
